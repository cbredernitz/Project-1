Hello!

This is my testing code for SI 507 F17.  The python script named SI507F17_project1_cards.py simulates two players playing a game of war.  After the game has completed, the script will then search the itunes API for a song to play under the category "winner" and play that song.  Given this file, our task was the write test cases to identify the 3 bugs in the cards script.  In order to find these bugs, I have written the SI507F17_project1_tests.py to run and figure out which functions to make changes to in order for the game to play as intended outlined in the code_description txt file.

To clone this repo, simply type in your terminal:

git clone git@github.com:cbredernitz/Project-1.git

To get all the required pip installations, type:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will download all the pip installations you need at once to run this program.

Thanks!
