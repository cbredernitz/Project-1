## Do not change import statements.

## Write your unit tests to test the cards code here.
## You should test to ensure that everything explained in the code description file works as that file says.
## If you have correctly written the tests, at least 3 tests should fail. If more than 3 tests fail, it should be because multiple of the test methods address the same problem in the code.
## You may write as many TestSuite subclasses as you like, but you should try to make these tests well-organized and easy to read the output.
## You should invoke the tests with verbosity=2 (make sure you invoke them!)
